The central microservice of the [___SpatioTemporal Feature eXtractor (stfX)___](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/stfX). This service, built using [spring](https://spring.io), is responsible for everything that is not the computation of spatiotemporal change features. More specifically, this service responsibilities include:
- [x] Aggregation of the spatiotemporal change features computed by the remaining services;
- [x] Storing temporal snapshots as well as the corresponding extracted spatiotemporal change features;
- [x] Filter the obtained spatiotemporal change features according to the user inputted thresholds, thus obtaining the features of interest;
- [x] Identification of immutability (feature presented in section~\ref{sol:novel-change-features});
- [x] Filtering of noise produced by the utilised computation methods;
- [x] Indexing of spatiotemporal change features according to the temporal range;
- [x] Identification of unimportant temporal ranges;
- [x] Coalescing of features of interest.


This server's updated API can be consulted [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/EdgarACarneiro/thesis/2.1.1).

Section 5.2.2 of the __[thesis](https://github.com/EdgarACarneiro/stfX/blob/master/docs/thesis.pdf)__ associated to the _stfX_ contains a detailed description of this microservice architecture and general guidelines.

# _stfXCore_ packages overview

| __Package__ | __Description__ |
|:-|:-|
| __Models__ | CRUD interface for the data entities managed in the application. Models do not handle any business logic, solely entity self-contained logic. |
| __Controllers__ | Responsible for handling the _stfX_ API endpoints and further delegate actions to the other architecture components. |
| __Repositories__ | Specify persistence in the database using ORM. |
| __Services__ | Fetch data from the Models, handle it and then provide the processed data to the Controllers. The majority of the business logic is implemented here. |

The figure below illustrates how different components of the _stfXCore_ interact to retrieve the spatiotemporal change features of interest to the end-user.

# Getting started

To run a container with the application, in a standalone manner, use:
```shell
cd stfXCore
sh docker-build.sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 stfx-core
```
